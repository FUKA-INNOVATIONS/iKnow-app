- As discussed with Peter, there was no sense to use repository layer although it is added and can be found under data/database/repository folder
- For best experience and testing purposes use API 30
- Application has fullfilled all requirements === 5 starts!

## Deployment

  - App is compatible for API versions 30 and under
  - Enable fingerprint features in device settings
  - Google Safe Browsing Lookup API requires Google API key which can be created [here](https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/api-keys?hl=en&ref_topic=6262490&visit_id=638142279115738534-374310817&rd=1#console) 
  - Create apikey.properties file in the root of the project
  - Inside the apikey.properties file add
```bash 
SBL_API_KEY="YOUR_API_KEY" 
```
